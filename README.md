Portfolio
=========

This is a portfolio repo for my projects to showcase future employers

This is a website which enables a (in this case computer) repair shop to centralize it's customer base, repair tickets, technicians,..
It will also contain a webshop (needs to be created)
All in ASP.NET MVC with Entity Framework for the database approach.
The database files need to be uploaded, working on a solution to create a new database if none exsist.
